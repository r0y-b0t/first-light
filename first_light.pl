hook(description("The time will come, when thou shalt lift thine eyes\n\c
To watch a long-drawn battle in the skies.\n\c
While aged peasants, too amazed for words,\n\c
Stare at the flying fleets of wond’rous birds.\n\c
\n\c
England, so long mistress of the sea,\n\c
Where winds and waves confess her sovereignty\n\c
Her ancient triumphs yet on high shall bear,\n\c
And reign, the sovereign of the conquered air.\n\c

Dedicated to the memory of Squadron Leader Geoffrey Wellum DFC, 1921-2018, and to all the pilots who fought in the Battle of Britain on both sides.\n\c

# First Light

    The time will come, when thou shalt lift thine eyes
    To watch a long-drawn battle in the skies.
    While aged peasants, too amazed for words,
    Stare at the flying fleets of wondâ€™rous birds.

    England, so long mistress of the sea,
    Where winds and waves confess her sovereignty
    Her ancient triumphs yet on high shall bear,
    And reign, the sovereign of the conquered air.

Dedicated to the memory of Squadron Leader Geoffrey Wellum DFC,
1921-2018, and to all the pilots who fought in the Battle of Britain on
both sides.

Eagle Day starts 13 August 1940. The German Luftwaffe attacks RAF fighter command.

There were no Focke-Wulf's 190's (the Shrike) operating in 1940; it was still
under development. Bf 109E (E for Emil) was the only single-engine fighter
operating in the Third Reich.
